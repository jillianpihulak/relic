##### Map Design
I decided to create a map with a vintage feel as a starting point for my final project. I used yellows, blues, and greens that I found
on maps from the 1950's and 1960's to create an older feel. I found fonts (using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/))to create an 
older feel. For the water lables, I went for more of an older, nautical feel, and for the lables on
land, I stuck to a similar style that I'd seen on vintage maps.
